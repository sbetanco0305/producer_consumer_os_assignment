Topic: Producer-Consumer Problem: The producer generates items and puts items onto the table. The consumer will pick up items. The table can only hold two items at the same time. When the table is completed, the producer will wait. When there are no items, the consumer will wait. We use semaphores to synchronize the producer and the consumer.
